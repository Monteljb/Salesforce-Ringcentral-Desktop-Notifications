A Well Known Closet Company missed out on alot of leads due to an inefficeint notfication alerts provided natively by ring central inside of the SalesForce CRM system. 

I proposed a Desktop Alert Soulution that would grab the Users attetion during inbound calls. The application delivers an audio and visual alert to all users in the call center of incoming calls from Ring central service embedded into SalesForce. A window springs into the center of the users computer, alerting any users with the program running of a current inbound call. The results show an 85% decrease in leads lost.

The alert will stay present as long as someone is calling. Fades away when someones answers or clicks close window. Along with the visual alert is an repeating audio alert!
